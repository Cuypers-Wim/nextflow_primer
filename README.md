# A Quick Primer on Building Bioinformatics Pipelines with Nextflow

Recently, I transitioned from using my favorite bash scripts to adopting Nextflow for the sake of creating more reproducible and portable pipelines. This primer shares my experience learning Nextflow to develop a robust bioinformatics pipeline for metagenomics. Although there were initial challenges, such as limited support from tools like ChatGPT, I’ve since discovered several key benefits of using Nextflow, which I’m excited to share.

This primer also covers the main structure and syntax of Nextflow, providing a practical guide to help you efficiently build your own pipelines. It was created in the context of our annual retreat with the Adrem Data Lab, also known as Rebootcamp 2024.
